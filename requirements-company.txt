# CQViewer - Approved dependencies only

# CLI dependencies (optional - works without these but output is nicer)
rich                    # Beautiful terminal output
tabulate                # Table formatting

# UI dependencies (required for run_ui.py)
streamlit>=1.30         # Web UI framework
pandas>=2.1             # Data manipulation

# Note: All core functionality uses Python standard library only.
# The CLI (run_cli.py) works without any external dependencies,
# but rich/tabulate provide better formatting.
